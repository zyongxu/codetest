Word count is a task that could appear in various *context*. The way of counting
words in a data set with 10GB text files may be totally different from the way
to count in a single source code file or an email.

Here, I presented two totally separate ways to do that:
I used C++ to write the counter from stratch to handle large text files. The time complicity is O(n) where n is the total number of words in the input file

I used python and handful built-in functions to create a fast approach.

If you only accept one answer, I would choose the C++ version as my single
answer since it may give you a better sense of my programming skills in
complitcated problems.
