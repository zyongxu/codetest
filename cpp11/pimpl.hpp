/*
 * The compiler firewall and pimpl idiom
 *
 * About what should goes into that XImpl* impl_:
 * Put all nonvirtual private members into XImpl. After all, in C++,
 * the phrase "client code shouldn't and doesn't care about these
 * parts" is spelled "private"â€”and privates are always hidden
 *
 * pimpl has two overhead in performance:
 *  1. the pimpl_ requires memory allocation, which is slow
 *  2. calling funcs in XImpl by pimpl_->xxx() has a indirection
 *
 * As with any other optimization, use Pimpls in general and
 * Fast Pimpls in particular only after profiling and experience
 * prove that the extra performance boost is really needed in your situation
 *
 * Stack allocation is much faster since all it really does is move the stack pointer.
 * Using memory pools, you can get comparable performance out of heap allocation,
 * but that comes with a slight added complexity and its own headaches.
